# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The
format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
once it reaches 1.0.

## [Unreleased]

Tracked in `ROADMAP.md`. Highlights still pending: DSL list
matchers (`p:unordered-list(N)`); custom `underline` mappers; CLI
`--style-map FILE`; track-changes deletion concatenation.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- **PHPStan 2.2 compatibility in `StylesReader`**: under PHPStan 2.2's
  stricter empty-array-shape inference, the style-deduplication
  `isset()` checks were flagged as `isset.offset` ("offset on
  `array{}`") and `booleanAnd.alwaysFalse`. The paragraph, character
  and table style maps are now explicitly typed as
  `array<string, Style>` (and the numbering pointer map as
  `array<string, string>`) so the lookups are recognised. No
  behavioural change.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-28

### Added

- **Hidden-text handling**: runs carrying the `w:vanish` ("Hidden")
  font effect are now parsed into a new `Run::$isHidden` flag, and a
  `Converter` / `DocumentConverter` option `ignoreHiddenText` controls
  whether they are rendered. The `w:vanish` element follows the usual
  boolean toggle rules (`w:val="false"` / `"0"` disables the effect).

### Changed

- **Hidden text is dropped by default**: with `ignoreHiddenText` on
  (the default), runs marked `w:vanish` are omitted from the HTML and
  Markdown output, so it matches what Word shows on screen and in
  print. The parsed `Document` still keeps the runs (flagged
  `isHidden`) so `transformDocument` callbacks can inspect them. This
  diverges from mammoth.js, which keeps hidden text. Pass
  `ignoreHiddenText: false` to restore the previous behaviour and emit
  hidden runs as ordinary text.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- **Markdown emphasis broken by leading/trailing `<br>`**: a soft
  line break at the very start or end of a `<strong>`/`<em>` (and
  other emphasis) wrapper was emitted as `"  \n"` *inside* the
  delimiters, e.g. `**  \nName**`, which CommonMark refuses to
  parse as emphasis (the opener requires non-whitespace adjacent
  to the marker). The whitespace-hoisting pass now also pulls
  leading and trailing `<br>` elements out of emphasis wrappers,
  so the markers stay flush against text and the line break is
  preserved as a hard break outside the wrapper.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-28

Public API expansion to bring elephant-php to feature parity with
mammoth's documented options, plus a security review that closes
three vulnerabilities in the externally fed code paths.

### Added

- **`Converter` options:** `idPrefix`, `ignoreEmptyParagraphs`,
  `prettyPrint`, `transformDocument` — all mirroring mammoth's
  same-named options. Defaults preserve existing behaviour.
- **`Transforms` helpers** (`paragraph`, `run`, `elementsOfType`,
  `elements`, `getDescendants`, `getDescendantsOfType`) for
  walking and rebuilding the document tree, paired with
  `transformDocument`. Backed by a new `HasChildren` interface
  implemented by Document, Paragraph, Run, Hyperlink, Table,
  TableRow, TableCell so each container exposes
  `getChildren()` / `withChildren()`.
- **Checkbox form fields:** `<w:sdt><wordml:checkbox>` content
  controls and `FORMCHECKBOX` complex fields now produce
  `Checkbox` document nodes that render as
  `<input type="checkbox">` in HTML and `[x]` / `[ ]` in
  Markdown (composes naturally to GFM task lists inside `<li>`).
- **`numStyleLink` chasing in numbering:** an `<w:abstractNum>`
  pointing at a numbering-type `<w:style>` resolves transparently
  to that style's `<w:numId>`. Requires `Styles` to be passed to
  `NumberingReader`, which `Converter` now does automatically.
- **`findLevelByParagraphStyleId` fallback** in body reader: when
  a paragraph has only a styleId and no `<w:numPr>`, but the
  numbering definition tied a level to that style via
  `<w:lvl><w:pStyle>`, the paragraph picks up the level.
- **DSL style-map:** backslash escape sequences (`\n`, `\r`,
  `\t`, `\\`, `\'`) inside `'...'` strings; `:separator('text')`
  modifier on path elements.

### Fixed (security)

- **r:link images are no longer fetched from disk.** Mammoth
  resolves `<a:blip r:link="...">` via `fs.readFile` on the
  relationship target; the path is attacker-controlled in any
  user-uploaded scenario, exposing SSRF (`http://internal/...`),
  LFI (`file:///etc/passwd`), `phar://` deserialisation and
  arbitrary file reads via traversal. The reader now refuses to
  load r:link bytes outright; the path is preserved on the Image
  node so a `transformDocument` hook can make a different choice
  after seeing the document.
- **`javascript:` / `vbscript:` / `data:` hyperlinks are stripped.**
  Match is case-insensitive and tolerates leading whitespace and
  control characters (browsers do too). The `<a>` wrapper is
  dropped; children render inline. `mailto:`, `tel:`, `https:`,
  fragments, etc. flow through unchanged.
- **XML parsing rejects DOCTYPE and disables network entity
  loads.** Combined with the explicit `LIBXML_NONET` flag now
  passed to `loadXML`, this neutralises XXE and billion-laughs:
  an entity that's never read can't be expanded. Real OOXML
  never declares a DOCTYPE.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-27

Cleaner Markdown output and faithful Word numbering. The public API is
unchanged; output format has shifted in ways that may affect downstream
consumers diffing rendered Markdown.

### Changed

- **Bold marker switched from `__` to `**`.** The double-underscore
  wrapper clashed with literal underscore runs (Word fill-in fields
  like `_______`), breaking surrounding emphasis. Asterisks have no
  intraword conflict in docx-derived content.
- **Replaced mammoth's blanket text escape with a context-aware one.**
  `*`, `_`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}` are never escaped; `#`, `+`, `-`, `.`
  only when at line start in a position that would parse as syntax;
  `[` and `]` only when forming the inline-link pattern `[text](url)`
  (citation-style brackets like `[1]`, `[Nota]`, `[sic]` stay
  literal); `!` only before such a link pattern. `\` and backtick
  remain always escaped.

### Added

- **Honour `<w:start>` from numbering definitions.** Word's exporter
  often splits a visually continuous "1., 2., 3." sequence into
  separate single-item ordered lists, each with its own `<w:start>`
  in the abstract numbering. Previously every chunk restarted at 1;
  the converter now forwards `start` on `<ol>` and the Markdown
  writer renders the first item from that number. `NumberingLevel`
  gained an optional `start: ?int` field.

### Fixed

- **Drop HTML `<a id="...">` anchors from Markdown output.** Bookmarks
  (Word's `_Toc...`, `_Hlk...`, `_Ref...`) used to leak into the
  Markdown as raw HTML; they are now silently elided. Real links
  (`<a href>`) are unaffected. HTML output keeps the anchors as
  before.

## [0.1.0] — initial release

First public release. Functionally equivalent to mammoth.js for typical
real-world documents (paragraphs, headings, runs, hyperlinks, lists,
tables, images, footnotes, comments, symbols, complex-field hyperlinks).

### Added

- Public API: `Converter::convertToHtml`, `convertToMarkdown`,
  `extractRawText`, `embedStyleMap`, `readEmbeddedStyleMap`.
- HTML and Markdown output from a shared intermediate document model.
- Style-mapping DSL (mammoth-compatible subset): paragraph, run, run
  property (`b/i/u/strike/all-caps/small-caps`), `comment-reference`,
  `highlight[color='X']`, `br[type='X']`, `table` matchers; element
  paths with `.class` and `[attr='val']` modifiers and the `:fresh`
  flag; `!` for ignore.
- Default style map that mirrors mammoth's heading rules
  (`Heading 1..6` → `h1..h6`).
- Reader features: paragraphs, runs (bold, italic, underline,
  strikethrough, all-caps, small-caps, sub/sup, highlight, font,
  fontSize), hyperlinks (regular and complex-field `HYPERLINK`), nested
  lists (mixed ordered/unordered), tables (`gridSpan` → colspan,
  `vMerge` → rowspan, `tblHeader` → `<thead>`), images (embedded via
  `r:embed` and linked via `r:link`, optional wrap in `<a>` from
  `wp:docPr/a:hlinkClick`), footnotes and endnotes with backlinks,
  comments (opt-in render via `comment-reference =>` DSL), content
  controls (`w:sdt`), `w:tab`, line/page/column breaks, bookmarks
  (`w:bookmarkStart`, except the synthetic `_GoBack`), no-break and
  soft hyphens, `w:sym` symbol fonts (Wingdings / Webdings / Symbol
  via the dingbat-to-unicode table), `mc:AlternateContent` collapsing.
- Native Markdown writer (port of mammoth's
  `lib/writers/markdown-writer.js`); CommonMark-aware whitespace
  cleanup so `__   bold   __` and tab-indented paragraphs render
  correctly instead of as code blocks.
- CLI `bin/elephant-php` (HTML / Markdown to stdout or file).
- CI on PHP 8.2 / 8.3 / 8.4 / 8.5 (Pint, PHPStan level 8, Pest).

### Documented limitations

- DSL list matchers (`p:unordered-list(N)`): list rendering is
  imperative, not DSL-driven. Functionally equivalent.
- `w:basedOn` style chains: not resolved (mammoth doesn't either).
- OMML equations, SmartArt, track changes, checkbox form fields:
  dropped or warned, matching mammoth's behaviour.
